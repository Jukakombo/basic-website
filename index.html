            ― MY BACKGROUND I’ve gone through a number of phases in my career,
            and each of them has informed my current work ethos and philosophy.
            I have excelled in a number of project management roles in diverse
            industries, and believe that my number one asset is my ability to
            adapt to any challenge that is thrown my way.

            <p>
              We've worked on many projects together with Brooke at Stilltech,
              and she's a true asset to any team. She's a team player, but think
              on her feet and never settles for a no. Her ambition and passion
              for what she does is uncanny, and it's been a pleasure to see her
              progress and grow more confident in her professional role over
              time. I thoroughly recommend her for any leadership or project
              management roles.
